Search and Reporting Application Website 
 Created a website with multiple menu options.
 Submenus have link references to other sites, browser information using JavaScript BOM (Browser Object Model) and searching using a file, or the Google Search API.
 Search from a file reads in an uploaded file of type JSON, CSV, and XML that contain the title, description and URL of websites.
 Search via the Google API allows an entry through a search box and displays the results by passing it to the Google Search Engine.
 Search results include checkboxes and select/deselect options for the user to choose which results to save. 
 Selected results can be converted back to JSON, XML, and CSV and be downloaded by the user with the desired filename
